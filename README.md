By: Gabriel Diaz de Leon

Carryout coupons analyzed due to their representative proportion and high/consistent acceptance rate

•	The acceptance rate for carryout coupons is larger than for any other group, with a value over 70%
•	Carryout coupons have the highest acceptance rate across all education and income groups, serving as a good candidate for further study


PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
What variables demonstrate changes in acceptance rates related to carryout coupons, and what is the effect they have?

1)	Widows and divorcees have a higher rate of accepting carryout coupons than other marital statuses
2)	Carryout coupons are largely accepted by most people regardless of demographics and location where coupon was received
3)	Coupons are increasingly accepted through the course of the day, regardless of education level
4)	Acceptance rates based on income groups are extremely disimilar between the youngest ages and the oldest ages
5)	Older individuals have similar rates of acceptance, indicating a certain degree of consistency
6)	Low-income groups have similar acceptance rates across ages compared to some low-income groups, as well as the highest income groups
7)	High income groups have negative correlation across ages, meaning that depending on the level of wealth, different ages take distinct stances on accepting carryout coupons
8)	The greater the frequency of ordering carryout, the greater the increase in acceptance rate when there is no urgent destination
9)	As people visit carryout restaurants more frequently, the acceptance rate decreases when there is an urgent destination (habituation)

ACTION STEPS:
1) Carryout coupons have a greater acceptance rate when the customers do not order carryout too frequently or too infrequently
2) Targeting divorcees and widows could be a way to increase sales
3) Income, education and age do not demonstrate a clear relationship with changes in acceptance rate, consider further sampling for clarification
